## The Rules (Feynman Rules)

You have a **list of lines** (particles) and a **list of vertices** (interactions) that you're allowed to use. You can use as many copies of these "rules" as you need to.

### Theory A

For example, here are the rules for **theory A**: 







### Theory B

Here's a slightly more complicated theory, **theory B**. We denote the $B$ particle with a wiggly line. This is just a style to distinguish it from the straight line.







### Properties of The Rules

You can move or rotate the lines however you want. 





Lines may "pass over," but they can only **intersect** through an allowed vertex.







## The Game (physical process)

The goal of the game is to draw a *physical process*. 

### Initial and Final States

A **physical process** connects some specified **initial state** ("in state") to some specified **final state** ("out state").  

States are endpoints of lines; they specify the particles that you start with and the particles that you end with. Examples of states are

* 3 particles of type $A$
* 2 $A$ particles and a $B$ particle

A physical process is a set of diagrams. Each diagram has the *initial state on the left* and the *final state on the right*:







### The Challenge

Use The Rules to draw a *graph*, or **Feynman Diagram**, that connects the *initial states* to the *final state*. A graph (Feynman Diagram) is any number of lines connected by vertices.  

Here are some examples of Feynman Diagrams for Theory A:







Here are some examples of *not allowed* Feynman diagrams for Theory A:















### Disconnected graphs

Sometimes you can draw graphs that are *disconnected*. For example:







These graphs do not count. We only care about *connected* graphs where there is some sequence of lines that connects every point to every other point.







### Equivalent graphs

The initial and final states are fixed. This *pins down* the end points of the graph. Everything inside can be "pulled tight." The position of vertices does not matter; these are all equivalent graphs:







Internal lines can go in any direction or curve as needed to reach vertices. These are all equivalent graphs:







We try to make the graphs as "pretty" as possible. Make lines straight when they can be straight. 







Note that you *cannot* move the initial or final states (endpoints). The following graphs in Theory B are two *different* graphs:









### Observations

* For some initial and final states, there is *no physical process* allowed. You cannot draw a graph satisfying the rules. 

  Usually we can come up with rules for when a process is allowed that doesn't require trying to draw graphs. Often we have to start by trying to draw graphs and seeing what causes us to fail.

* For some physical processes, there are *many* graphs you can draw. How many? (Is the number big or small?)

  If there are many graphs, maybe we should have some guidelines on which graphs to prioritize? 



## The Game, Part II

Let's make the game more precise. 

1. Given an *initial state* and a *final state*, identify whether or not you can draw a graph that connects everything.

   If you cannot, try to come up with a rule for why you cannot.

2. If you can, then you've drawn a *physical process*. You can probably draw more than one distinct graph. 

   Your goal is to draw the **simplest** possible graphs. This means the graphs with the *fewest number of vertices*.  

3. The last step is to decide if the *physical process* is **kinematically allowed**. This is something where we decide based in the initial state and final states alone.  [We'll do this next lecture.]



## Quantum Electrodynamics: The Game

Here's our first "real" theory of particle physics. It is called **quantum electrodynamics**. For now, it's just a theory with the following rules:







Call the solid lines $e$ and the wiggly lines $\gamma$. 

Observe that there's something new here: the straight lines have an arrow. This means they have an *orientation*. You can distinguish a line going into a vertex versus a line coming out of the vertex. You can rotate the lines so you can have arrows that move "forward" or "backward":









 

The single vertex that we have always has an arrow coming in and an arrow coming out. The following are *not* rules:







For initial and final states with solid lines, we have to specify the direction of the arrows. Here's our convention:

* Initial states with arrows going *into* the diagram (to the *right*) are labeled $e$.  (Sometime these are called $e^-$ for reasons you may guess.)
* Initial states with arrows going *out of* the diagram (to the *left*) are labeled $\bar e$. (Or $e^\dagger$ or $e^*$ or $e^+$.)
* Final states with arrows going *into* the diagram (to the *left*) are labeled $\bar e$. 
* Final states with arrows going *out of* the diagram (to the right*) are labeled $e$. 

### Simple Examples

We specify the *in* and *out* states by asking for a physical process of the form: $$\text{in} \to \text{out}$$

1. â€‹	These are the simplest diagrams for $ee \to ee$ (or $e+e \to e+e$):

   

   

   

   

   

   Here are the next-simplest diagrams (requires more vertices) for $ee\to ee$. Because it's more complicated, we don't need them for now.

2. Here are the simplest diagrams for $e\bar e \to e\bar e$:









### Challenges

1. What, if any, are the simplest diagrams for $e\gamma \to e\gamma$?
2. What is the next-simplest diagram for  $e\bar e \to e\bar e$? (Example 2 above.)
3. What, if any, are the simplest diagrams for $ee \to \gamma\gamma$?
4. What, if any, are the simplest diagrams for $e\bar e \to \gamma\gamma$?
5. What, if any, are the simplest diagrams for $e\bar e \to \gamma\gamma\gamma$?
6. What, if any, are the simplest diagrams for $e\to e\bar e e$?
7. What, if any, are the simplest diagrams for $\gamma \to ee\bar e\bar e$?
8. Is $e\bar e \to 100 \gamma$ possible? (One hundred $\gamma$ in the final state)
9. Is $e\bar e\to 100 e$ possible?
10. Is $e\bar e \to 100e + 100\bar e$ possible?
11. Can you deduce rules to determine whether a process is physical (you can draw a graph) based on the initial and final states alone?
